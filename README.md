# Lalamove Unofficial Client Library for Node.js

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* Node.js (version 4.x or above)

## Installation
Install this library via npm:
```
npm install lalamove-js
```

## General Order Flow
1. Get quotation for the delivery
2. Place order with the quotation returned in Step 1
3. Check the order status / Cancel Order

## Usage
> You must obtain Lalamove Sandbox API credential from Lalamove Sales Representative to kickstart your integration process.

Step 1: Instantiate a Lalamove object

```javascript
var lalamove = require('./index') ({
  host: 'https://sandbox-rest.lalamove.com',
  key: '12345',      // Obtained from Lalamove Sales Team
  secret: '12345',   // Obtained from Lalamove Sales Team
  country: 'SG'
})
```

### Order Quotation
Step 1: Set body for order quotation

```javascript
var body = {
    'serviceType': 'MOTORCYCLE',
    'scheduleAt': '2018-06-13T12:00:00:00Z' // Note: This is in UTC Timezone
    'specialRequests': [],
    'requesterContact': {
        'name': 'Draco Yam',
        'phone': '+6592344758'
    },
    'stops': [
        {
            'location': {'lat': '1.284318', 'lng': '103.851335'},
            'addresses': {
                'en_SG': {
                    'displayString': '1 Raffles Place #04-00, One Raffles Place Shopping Mall, Singapore',
                    'country': 'SG'
                }
            }
        },
        {
            'location': {'lat': '1.278578', 'lng': '103.851860'},
            'addresses': {
                'en_SG': {
                    'displayString': 'Asia Square Tower 1, 8 Marina View, Singapore',
                    'country': 'SG'
                }
            }
        }
    ],
    'deliveries': [
        {
            'toStop': 1,
            'toContact': {
                'name': 'Brian Garcia',
                'phone': '+6592344837'
            },
            'remarks': 'ORDER #: 1234, ITEM 1 x 1, ITEM 2 x 2'
        }
    ]
  }

```

`serviceType` - The mode of delivery

`scheduleAt` - The pickup time of the delivery

`specialRequests` - Extra handling requests for the delivery
> Contact Lalamove Sales Team to learn more about available **service types** & **special requests** in your city.

`requestorContact` - This is the contact information of the person who is placing the order. Once a driver is matched with the order, the driver will contact the order placer via this number.
> Note: This information will also be mapped to the contact person of first location.

> Note on phone number format: There is a '0' between the international code and phone number for all countries except HK and SG (e.g. +66**0**20345252 for Thailand)

`stops` - This is an array of stops. The first stop is the goods pickup location. The first delivery location start from the second stop.
> `location` can be omitted if latitude-longitude pair is not available. `displayString` will be used to geocode the location.

`deliveries` - This is an array of contact information of each delivery stop. Please note: `toStop` of 1 maps to the second stop in `stops`.

Step 2: Call Quotation Method
```javascript
  var quotation = lalamove.quotation(body)
    .then(function (response) {
      return response
    })
```
The response should be returned with the follow fields:
```
  {
    "totalFeeCurrency": "SGD",
    "totalFee": "10"
  }
```
### Order Placing
Step 1: Using the **same body** as order quotation, add the following attributes to the JSON body:
```javascript
'quotedTotalFee': {
  "amount": "10",
  "currency": "SGD"
},
'callerSideCustomerId': ''  // Optional
```

`quotedTotalFee` - This must be the same price as the price returned from the quotation endpoint in the previous step.

`callerSideCustomerId` - [Optional] This is used for inputting a tracking ID if you have one. This information will be shown to driver for order and goods verification purposes.

Step 2: Call postOrder Method
```javascript
  var postedOrder = lalamove.postOrder(body)
    .then(function (response) {
      return response
    })
```
The response should be returned with the follow fields:
```
  {
    "customerOrderId": "a6378ec5-6ef1-11e8-a733-06bff2d87e1b",
    "orderRef": "130343"
  }
```

`customerOrderId` - A unique order identifier used in system communications

`orderRef` - A unique order identifier used for communications with Lalamove Customer Service.

### Order Status

An order can have these order statuses: `ASSIGNING_DRIVER`, `ON_GOING`,  `PICKED_UP`, `COMPLETE`, `CANCELED`, `REJECTED`, `EXPIRED`

```javascript
  var orderStatus = lalamove.getOrderStatus(customerOrderId)
    .then(function (response) {
      return response
    })
```
The response should be returned with the follow fields:
```
  {
    "driverId": "",
    "status": "ASSIGNING_DRIVER"
  }
```

### Driver Contact Information

Once the order is matched, you can get the contact information of the driver.

```javascript
  var driverInfo = lalamove.getDriverInfo(customerOrderId, driverId)
    .then(function (response) {
      return response
    })
```
The response should be returned with the follow fields:
```
  {
    "name": "David",
    "phone": "+6592344758"
  }
```

### Driver Location

Once the order is matched, you can get the location of the driver.

```javascript
  var driverInfo = lalamove.getDriverInfo(customerOrderId, driverId)
    .then(function (response) {
      return response
    })
```
The response should be returned with the follow fields:
```
  {
    "location": { "lat": "13.740167", "lng": "100.535237" },
    "updatedAt": "2017-12-01T14:30.00Z"
  }
```

### Cancel Order

You can cancel the order anytime before a driver is matched with the order and 5 minutes after the driver is matched.
> Note that this is the time when driver is matched, not the time when the order status is called.

```javascript
  var driverInfo = lalamove.cancelOrder(customerOrderId)
    .then(function (response) {
      return response
    })
```
